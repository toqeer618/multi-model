# Multi-Modal Analysis and Caption Generation for Cryptocurrency News Images

## Project Overview
This project encompasses the complete lifecycle of working with cryptocurrency news images, from data collection to analysis and caption generation. It's divided into several key components:

## 1. Data Collection

### Objective
Gather a dataset of 10,000 cryptocurrency-related images from Cointelegraph.

### Process
Utilize web scraping techniques to extract images from Cointelegraph's online resources. Ensure that the dataset encompasses a variety of topics related to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoins, and more. Categorize these images into 10 classes according to their content.

## 2. Image Classification

### Objective
Develop models that can accurately classify the cryptocurrency news images into their respective categories.

### Custom Models
- Utilize traditional machine learning techniques to create custom image classification models. Techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), Word2Vec embeddings, and PyTorch embedding layers will be employed to represent text features.
- Build custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze image content. These models will undergo training to learn patterns and features present in the images.

### Pre-trained Models
- Harness the power of pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, and ImageNet. Fine-tune these models using transfer learning techniques, enabling them to excel in cryptocurrency image classification.

## 3. Multi-Modal Classification

### Objective
Combine information from both images and text (article titles) to create more accurate predictions.

### Custom Models
- Create custom embedding layers to represent text features in various ways, such as BoW, Word2Vec, and PyTorch embedding.
- Design a custom CNN that takes both image and text embeddings as inputs and makes joint predictions, providing a comprehensive analysis.

### Pre-trained Models
- Leverage pre-trained models like BERT and its variations for analyzing text. This allows the system to understand the textual context and nuances in cryptocurrency news.
- Combine the outputs from image-based and text-based models to perform classification based on both modalities, improving classification accuracy.

## 4. Image Caption Generation

### Objective
Create a system capable of generating informative and contextually relevant captions for the cryptocurrency news images.

### Approaches
- Implement custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models to comprehend the content within the images. These models will provide a foundation for generating meaningful captions.
- Utilize the U-Net architecture, a specialized neural network structure, to facilitate image-to-image translation. This enhances the image captioning process, enabling the generation of high-quality captions.

## Technical Details
- **Programming and Libraries**: The project will use widely adopted programming languages and libraries, such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is critical, including tasks such as image resizing, text tokenization, and embedding generation.
- **Model Enhancement**: The project involves implementing data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of models.
- **Performance Metrics**: Model performance will be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, and caption quality metrics.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to fine-tune the models for optimal performance.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface or web application will be developed to showcase the project's capabilities, making it accessible to users.

## Expected Outcomes
- A dataset containing 10,000 cryptocurrency-related images obtained from Cointelegraph.
- Image classification models capable of accurately categorizing cryptocurrency news images into their respective topics.
- Multi-modal classification models that combine image and text data to provide more accurate predictions.
- An image captioning system that generates informative and relevant captions for cryptocurrency news images.

This project encompasses a holistic approach to cryptocurrency news analysis, utilizing a combination of image and text analysis techniques and leveraging both custom and pre-trained models. It not only demonstrates the potential of AI and deep learning but also provides a practical tool for users interested in cryptocurrency news content.
